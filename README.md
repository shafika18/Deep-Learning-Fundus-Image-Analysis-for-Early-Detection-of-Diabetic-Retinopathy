# Deep-Learning-Fundus-Image-Analysis-for-Early-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy

Deep Learning Fundus Image Analysis for Early Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy is a medical imaging project aimed at using advanced deep learning techniques to analyze fundus images of the retina. The goal is to detect signs of diabetic retinopathy in its early stages, enabling timely intervention and treatment to prevent vision loss in diabetic patients. By leveraging deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system can automatically identify and classify retinal abnormalities with high accuracy and efficiency.
